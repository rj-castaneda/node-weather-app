express is more like a function rather than an object

express library exposes a single function as opposed to something like an object and we call it to create a new express application

how to integrate back-end and front-end:
* we need the browser to communicate with the server
    passing an address along
* then the server converts the address into a 
    forecast and pass it back to the browser
* the browser renders the forecast data to the screen

** To achieve this we create HTTP JSON end points with express
